# memberlist
Finished and uploaded January 21st, 2023. Used React, Node.JS, Express, and MySQL. This is a simple web application that allows the user to add members into a member tracking database in mySQL and displays it on the webpage. The user can also delete members or update each individual members (CRUD). Each member has its own user id, name, password, age, and phone number. <br />
You'll need to download Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/ <br />
To run: <br />
First create a table in a database in MySQL by typing: <br />
CREATE TABLE members ( <br />
	id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, <br />
	userid VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, <br />
	password VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, <br />
	name VARCHAR(20) default NULL, <br />
	age INT default NULL, <br />
	phone_num CHAR(10) NOT NULL, <br />
	createdAt DATE NOT NULL, <br />
	updatedAt DATE NOT NULL, <br />
	PRIMARY KEY (id) <br />
); <br />
Frontend: Go to the frontend directory in the command prompt and type "npm start" in the command prompt. <br />
Backend: Go to the backend/config/database.js file and enter the name of the database and the pasword <br />
Then go to the backend directory in the command prompt and type "npx nodemon index" in the command prompt. <br />

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
